<b>The </b><b>Mission</b>

The purpose of this project is to create an open source textbook/encylopedia from scratch. The goal is a to build a compilation of knowledge that is easily accessible and easy to understand. This idea is in it's very early stages and there will be many changes and updates to follow as the project structure is developed.

I will first be setting up a rough structure for the information. I will be breaking it down into sections and sub sections in order to keep things organized. This should allow contributors to focus great amounts of detail while still keeping it easy for the reader to find.

I will be adding a similar section/subsection structor for photographs. That way contributors can add interesting pictures without having to write articles surrounding them. You are welcome to use pictures that others have contributed, but make sure you credit the photographer.

I would like to have a book written that contains standard textbook type information, how to guides, practice or job sheets, definitions/key terms, and practice questions with answers. 

Ensure that all of your submitted materials are original and do not contain material belonging to anyone else. If you find something within the database that you believe to be plagiarized please inform me and I will investigate the situation.

While this project will have multiple contributors, for the time being I will be the primary moderator/editor.

<b>How </b><b>to </b><b>Contribute</b>

If you have an article or material that you would like to contribute please get in touch with me to discuss your idea before you put in the effort required to do the writing. I would like to get to a point where articles can be submitted freely, but as this project is in it's infancy it will require more collaboration to steer everything in the right direction.

Please submit any documents for review in .odt format. This allows contributions from all word processing software.

Please submit any photographs in .jpeg or .png format. Please ensure pictures are sharp, clear and well lit. Please feel free to use any pictures that have been submitted by others in your articles, but remember to credit the person that took the picture. 

<b>Recommended </b><b>Software</b>
